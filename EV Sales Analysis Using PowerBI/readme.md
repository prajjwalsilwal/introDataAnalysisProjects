In this Project, I used PowerBI to visualize the Electric Vehicle Sales from 2010 to 2022. This project really taught me a lot to get even more familiarized with PowerBI and utilize my learnings. I used the PowerBI functions to build an interactive dashboard that would show the different visualization charts based on the year.
