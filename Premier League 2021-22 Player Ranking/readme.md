In this project, I used both Python and Microsoft Excel to filter and visualize my rankings. 

I used Microsoft Excel to sort and filter the data and also rank the players according to my metrics. I also used Python to delete unnecessary rows to simplify my tasks. Then finally I used Matplotlib in Python to visualize my rankings. This was a really immersive experience where I had to use VLOOKUP and Python constantly to arrange my data.
